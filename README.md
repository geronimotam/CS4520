This repo serves as the proof for my source code for the course CS4520 Security and Cryptography at Technical University Delft.
2 python scripts are presented, main.py for part 1 and part3.py for part.
./ciphertext folder contains all the cipher texts. cipher text1 and 2 are part of the assignment, while text 3 and 4 are examples from the book: " Cryptography made simple" by N.P.Smart
